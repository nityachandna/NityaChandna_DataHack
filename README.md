Problem Description:

The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that estimates the likelihood of individuals receiving two specific types of vaccines: the xyz vaccine and the seasonal flu vaccine. To achieve this, we have predicted two separate probabilities: one representing the likelihood of an individual receiving the xyz vaccine and the other representing the likelihood of the same individual receiving the seasonal flu vaccine.
These predictions will help public health officials, healthcare providers, and policymakers better understand vaccination patterns and potentially improve vaccination strategies.

This project aims to leverage given data to build a robust model capable of accurately predicting the likelihood probabilities.

Following datasets have been utilized:
1. submission_format.csv
2. test_set_features.csv
3. training_set_features.csv
4. training_set_labels.csv

The final submission file, named as my_submission.csv, comprises of three columns: 
1. respondent_id
2. xyz_vaccine
3. seasonal_vaccine
   
The predictions for the two target variables are of float (type), probabilities that range between 0.0 and 1.0.
