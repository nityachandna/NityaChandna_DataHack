Problem Description:

The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that estimates the likelihood of individuals receiving two specific types of vaccines: the xyz vaccine and the seasonal flu vaccine. To achieve this, you will predict two separate probabilities: one representing the likelihood of an individual receiving the xyz vaccine and the other representing the likelihood of the same individual receiving the seasonal flu vaccine.
These predictions will help public health officials, healthcare providers, and policymakers better understand vaccination patterns and potentially improve vaccination strategies.
This project aims to leverage given data to build a robust model capable of accurately predicting the probabilities.
